Okay, here’s a summary of the video, incorporating both the visual and audio elements:

This video appears to be a somewhat unsettling and repetitive scene involving a woman (Julie) who is being repeatedly questioned about her identity. Visually, we see a woman sitting on a road, often surrounded by blurry figures and flashing lights, particularly during moments of heightened tension. The audio consists of a persistent, frantic plea – “Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, Julie. You have to tell me who you are. Tell me who is sitting next to on the road, just tell me who you are.” This repeated questioning creates a sense of disorientation and mystery, suggesting a possible abduction or confusion. The overall effect is strange and emphasizes the urgency and paranoia of the situation. 

Do you want me to focus on a particular aspect of the video, such as the recurring questions, the unsettling visuals, or the overall mood?
