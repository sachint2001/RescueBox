Hi guys, we're back. But here, Miss Purum is looking for never have I ever questions. Would it be playing never have I ever, not like I've done a lot of adventurous things for a short, we can give her a try. Your first question. Okay. Never have I ever broken a bone. Oh, I have not. I have had a ligament dead, but I've never had a broken bone. Never have I ever googled myself. Oh, I'm not that famous yet. So, I'm not yet. Never have I ever traveled solo. Oh, I did. I just did. I just went to Boston and from my lovely place. Traveling to the entire place. Yes, I did. The entire airport I was alone. And the entire plane also I was there. Never have I ever seen a ghost. Oh, I do everything. I knew they're coming. No, guys. This is like a few replace ghosts with an angel maybe this is never have ever toilet paper someone's house. And I never end in stone because we don't use toilet papers. Never have I ever laughed so hard. I spit out my drink. Oh, I did. I actually did it on my sports teacher. We went for a match or something. And then I had to do it on the teacher. We made a joke or something and then I spit out Sprite on him. Never have I ever pretended to be on the phone. On the phone. Phone? Oh, lots of times. Hundreds of times. Never have I ever met a celebrity. I would like to consider myself as a celebrity, but if you talk about other people maybe not. Never have I ever sleepwalked. No, but I've heard somebody sleep talk today. Never have I ever read an entire book in a day. Oh, I have lots of times. Tons of times. Never have I ever gone to a party I wasn't invited to. That also have done. Like people don't know me at a party and then and everybody is so drunk they still don't know me, but they pretend to know me. Oh, yeah. I've done that. Never have I ever stayed up all night, oh, that's your day, dude. Yeah, it's like the daily thing. I stay up all night. Okay.
