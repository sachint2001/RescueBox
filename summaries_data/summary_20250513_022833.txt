Okay, here’s a summary of the video, combining visual and audio information:

The video features two young women, Purum and her friend, engaging in a “Never Have I Ever” style game. Visually, they’re sitting together, smiling and interacting with each other.  The audio reveals a lighthearted and silly conversation as they answer increasingly personal questions. They recount humorous and surprising experiences, like breaking a bone (but not a *broken* one), Googling themselves, laughing so hard they spit out their drink, and attending parties where people pretend to know them. Overall, the video is a fun, spontaneous, and relatable glimpse into a casual conversation and a silly game. 

Do you want me to elaborate on any specific aspect of the video, like the questions they asked, or a particular anecdote they shared?
